\title{Splitting your data to construct overlays that mimic the four sections of
data used to calculate a one-way ANOVA.}
\usage{
ANOVA_overlay(dv, iv, data, common = mean)
}
\arguments{
\item{dv}{Character: What is the name of your dependent variable?}

\item{iv}{Character: What is the name of your independent variable?}

\item{data}{tibble or data frame: Your dataset containing your variables.}

\item{common}{function: which function should represent the common in the
splitting algorithm?}
}
\value{
a list of four tibbles, representing the four overlays: the data,
the common, the condition, and the residuals.
}
\description{
Splitting your data to construct overlays that mimic the four sections of
data used to calculate a one-way ANOVA.

\examples{
\dontrun{
# using dplyr to see the data split by condition, assuming a mean common
ToothGrowth \%>\% group_by(supp) \%>\% summarize(mn = mean(len))

# using ANOVA_overlay
ANOVA_overlay("len", "supp", ToothGrowth)
ANOVA_overlay("len", "supp", ToothGrowth, common = median)
ANOVA_overlay("len", "dose", ToothGrowth)

# Showing that the sums of the overlays add up to the data

toothGrowthOverlays <- ANOVA_overlay("len", "supp", ToothGrowth)
SS_data <- sum((toothGrowthOverlays$data)^2)
SS_overlays <- sum((toothGrowthOverlays$common)^2) + sum((toothGrowthOverlays$condition)^2) +
 sum((toothGrowthOverlays$residuals)^2)
